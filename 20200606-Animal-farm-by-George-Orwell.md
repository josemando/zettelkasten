## About the author
The author was Englishman born in India.

He studied on an elite school on England.

He joined the army and went back to India.

He was on Spanish Civil War.

He was socialist, but didn't agree with the Soviet Union.

He had a hard time publishing this book, because the publishers didn't want to upset
Stalin. The book was published on 17 August 1945. World War II ended on 2 September
1945.

## About the book
Old Major is probably based on Karl Marx or Lenin, or maybe both.

Snowball is probably based on Trotsky.

Napoleon is probably based on Stalin.

Maybe Moses was a representation of the Church.

Dogs are a representation of the police or army.

The lack of education made easier for the pigs to control other animals.

Things are easy to forget.

It was also important to have a common enemy: humans, Snowball and Frederick.

Pig used the sheep to maneuver the other animals.

It reminds me of Montesquieu, on The Spirit of the Laws: "...constant experience
shows us that every man who has power is inclined to abuse it; he goes until he
finds limits".

Aqueles que renunciam a liberdade em troca de promessas de seguran√ßa, acabem sem
uma nem outra.

Why Frederick invaded the farm and exploded the windmill?

Pink Floyd's album Animal is somehow based on the book, and talks about three animals:
Pigs, Dogs and Sheep.
