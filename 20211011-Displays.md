What should I look for when upgrading my monitor:
-   It needs to be at least a 4k monitor. Both 5k and 6k are also great, of course.
-   You need to use the integer scaling factor.

That means, if you have a 4k monitor (3840×2160), and use 2× scaling, you’ll get an equivalent of 1920×1080 logical pixels. So it’s a basic 1080p monitor in terms of how much you can fit, but with much crisper UI and text in everything.
