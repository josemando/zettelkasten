# 202005251205 Note-taking with Zettelkasten
#notetaking #productivity

Zettelkasten is a note-taking system where all notes are connected by tags and links between each other.

It is supposed to be a system for the rest of your life.

I want to try that to replace the millions of tabs, bookmarks, Instapaper and Pocket links that I have everywhere.
